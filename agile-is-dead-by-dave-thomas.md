I'm interested in this topic as it's always something needs to be interpreted. The basic rules are much simple than putting it into practice. We use "Agile" in our daily work. To be precise, it's an improved version of [SCRUM](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scrum_%28software_development%29) work flow. I can only follow the rules but I don't know what's the essence of the way we are doing it. Dave's talk helps unveil the underlying meaning.

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

### What's the "Agility" way?

Agility is not about what you do, but how you do it.

**What to Do**

* Find out where you are
* Take a small step towards your goal
* Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
* Repeat

**How to Do It**

* When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.

**Develop with agility**

* You aren’t an agile programmer - you’re a programmer who programs with agility.
* You don’t work on an agile team - your team exhibits agility.
* You don’t use agile tools - you use tools that enhance your agility.



I really love the example Dave used here, the PID controller, proportional integral derivative. This is definitely the way we proceed.

Another note is 

* No Rules Are Universal
* All Rules Need Context
